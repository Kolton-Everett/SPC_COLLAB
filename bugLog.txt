// CSS error with menus//
12/31/18 -
I noticed that all buttons on a page cover the menu when the page is scrolled. 
I tried adjusting the CSS on the wrapper to have a z-index less than that of the menu bar
 (basically this should have made the menu appear in fron tof the buttons). 
That didn't work, so we need to figure what exactly is wrong with this.
